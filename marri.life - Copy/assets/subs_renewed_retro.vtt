00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
Can see currently, I'm working on some stuff,

002
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.330
but for the most part, this is where all the inventory gets kept.

003
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.010
So this is everything that's in the middle of getting used.

004
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.400
And then any parts that I have on hand

005
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.780
for repairing stay over here and on this shelf.

006
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.280
And most of the parts that I have on hand

007
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.740
that aren't getting used are what gets listed on the shop.

008
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.720
And you can see basically, it's just like a super simple soldering setup.

009
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.020
Yeah, I have just all my stuff and drawers and everything.

010
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.900
And for the most part,

011
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.860
everything that gets done here is just Game Boys and computers.

012
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.420
I did do one switch, which I just finished.

013
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.680
And I am working on an old, I think it's a motorola Z-flip, or no, Z-slide.

014
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.560
I don't remember.

015
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.260
But yeah, so for the most part, Renewed Retro just works -

016
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.220
It's just me working on Game Boys,

017
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.290
just buying broken ones, fixing them, and then selling them.

018
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.410
And then I also sell whatever spare repair parts I have on hand.

019
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.960
But yeah.
